# **Rock Paper Scissors**
Rock Paper Scissors is a simple website that allows the user to play the classical game of rock paper scissors against a computer. The game is entirely randomised when it comes to the computer choice so its not incredibly difficult. 

The user chooses between 3 clickable buttons and gets responsive feedback below with whether he won, he lost, or it was a draw. The game then tracts the score so the user has a sense of accomplishment.
